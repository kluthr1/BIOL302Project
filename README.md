`AnnotatedPhageList.csv` contains a .csv file of all the annotated phages. This includes the 95 phages whose phage capsid length, capsid width, and tail length were measured. 

`UnannotatedPhageList.csv` contains a list of TEM images and phages whose genome size is known based on data avalible on PhagesDB. This list is later annotated in AnnotatedPhageList.csv

`PhageDB Search of Siphoviruses.ipynb` contains the python code used to generate `UnannotatedPhageList.csv` through searching phagesDB

`Linear Regression Model Code.ipynb` contains the python code used to generate figures and compute the genome size of phagesDB after annotating the phages in `AnnotatedPhageList.csv`
